# Planning-Project-PIRS-
The planning and execution of robotic tasks in dynamic environments requires
solutions that integrate both motion planning and high-level task planning. To address this
type of problem, we will use The Kautham Project (https://github.com/iocroblab/kautham), a software tool developed by the Institute of
Industrial Control (IOC-UPC)  that allows the implementation and testing of motion planning
algorithms. In this project, we will address a practical case study: a robot acting as a bartender
that must prepare and serve a caipirinha to a customer. This scenario represents a typical ex-
ample of manipulation that requires a coordinated sequence of actions and movements
